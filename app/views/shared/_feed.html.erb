<!-- render @feed_items defers the rendering to the _micropost partial.  Rails knows to call the micropost partial because each element of @feed_items has class Micropost.  This causes Rails to look for a partial with the corresponding name in the views directory of the given resource.  So it looks for app/views/microposts/_micropost.html.erb ... HOLY CRAP! -->
